    <h2>Interview with Hailey</h2>
    
    <!-- In the <p></p> tags, write a paragraph about your partner's online habits. -->
    <p>
      Hailey enjoys bouncing back and fourth between spending time on her phone and completely ignoring it. Social media and utility apps seem to be her top priority when using her phone. ( Tik Tok, Instagram, Depop, Apple Music, iMessage, Safari) Tik tok is dangerously addictive so all she really does is scroll past videos, similar to the rest of us. Her daily average spent on her phone is 7 hrs and 48 minutes and a total screen time of 23hrs and 26 minutes ( in the past three days)
