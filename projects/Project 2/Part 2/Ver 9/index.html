            <div style="background-color: #000000;color: white;">In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it. </div>
            <div id="white">And it was. </div>
        </div>
        <div id="text2">
            <div style="background-color: #000000;color: white;">In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it.</div>
            <div id="white">But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory's fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a letter). </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text3">
            <div style="background-color: #0a0a0a;color: white">A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, her whole life, and it was finally time to go in. </div>
            <div id="white">Not every poem is finished— </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text4">
            <div style="background-color: #0a0a0a;color: white">I love you. I am here with you. Don't be afraid. Go to sleep now.  </div>
            <div id="white">one poem is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.  </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text5">
            <div style="background-color: #121212;color: white">And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: </div>
            <div id="white">Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text6">
            <div style="background-color: #121212;color: white">I love you. I am here with you. Don't be afraid. Go to sleep now.  </div>
            <div id="white">The opening line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet's task is to create the tre from which such a fruit would fall.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="text7">
            <div style="background-color: #181818;color: white">In poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain.</div>
            <div id="white">Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text8">
            <div style="background-color: #181818;color: white">And I began to realize, reading these first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak. But.</div>
            <div id="white">That nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="text9">
            <div style="background-color: #1e1e1e;color: white">The first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same:</div>
            <div id="white">Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text10">
            <div style="background-color: #1e1e1e;color: white">I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools.</div>
            <div id="white">In the beginning was the Word. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text11">
            <div style="background-color: #242424;color: white">I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. </div>
            <div id="white">I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text12">
            <div style="background-color: #242424;color: white">But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. </div>
            <div id="white">Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="text13">
            <div style="background-color: #2a2a2a;color: white">How can the origin be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? </div>
            <div id="white">he mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="text14">
            <div style="background-color: #2a2a2a;color: white">It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being,</div>
            <div id="white">An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text15">
            <div style="background-color: #303030;color: white">but we can't go back to the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can't “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born. </div>
            <div id="white">But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text16">
            <div style="background-color: #303030;color: white">Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: </div>
            <div id="white">And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and explore. Hard lot! </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text17">
            <div style="background-color:#363636;color: white">Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. </div>
            <div id="white">A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. To pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text18">
            <div style="background-color: #363636;color: white">Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”</div>
            <div id="white">As the poet Ralph Angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text19">
            <div style="background-color: #3c3c3c;color: white">Bachelard;s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings). The poem is the consequence of its origins. </div>
            <div id="white">In other words, self-consciousness is theatre. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text20">
            <div style="background-color: #3c3c3c;color: white">Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. </div>
            <div id="white">The weird theatrical shit is what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater; theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe it from outside the circle; </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text21">
            <div style="background-color: #424242;color: white">Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.</div>
            <div id="white">Everyone knows that if you query poets about how their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text22">
            <div style="background-color: #424242;color: white">The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”</div>
            <div id="white">if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you haven't even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error. </div>
        </div>

        <div id="text23">
            <div style="background-color: #494949;color: white">I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word. </div>

            <div style="background-color: #494949;color: white">Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment. </div>
            <div id="white">I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea. </div>

            <div style="background-color: #4f4f4f;color: white">The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification; </div>

            <div style="background-color: #4f4f4f;color: white">the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it. </div>

            <div id="black">As the poet Ralph Angel puts it, “The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” </div>

            <div id="black">A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. To pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic theatre. </div>
            <div id="white">“Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. </div>

            <div id="black">But the poem, no matter how full of possibility, has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its individual character. </div>

            <div id="black">An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility. </div>

            <div id="black">The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out of ice, and it's your house. </div>

            <div id="black">Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it begins in the mind.</div>

            <div id="white">I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. </div>

            <div id="white">The first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same:</div>

        <div id="text8-reverse">
            <div id="black">that nothing can precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act. </div>

            <div id="black">Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud. </div>
