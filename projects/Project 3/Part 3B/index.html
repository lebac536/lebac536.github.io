                  This is a collection showing New York City's numerous neon signs.

              <div>
                  <br> <br>
                  The images are all taken at night to show the bright contrast of the neon in the signs 
                  against the black background. Some of them are already cropped, so I think I will continue
                  that through all the images so that they're all the same size. They are all from clubs, 
                  restaurants, and various other locations around NYC. They are taken with a smartphone camera.
                  None of them really have a specific material quality; they are all high resolution iphone
                  images, all with a lot of contrast with the black or dark background. I noticed that almost 
                  every single sign has some amount of red in it. It might be something I want to lean into 
                  with my site.
